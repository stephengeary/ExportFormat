# ExportFormat

This was a project I led  in order to overhaul our budget management process. The .xlsx file
that our team recieved contains the budgets, but the file was large and formatted in a way that made
it difficult to handle. I wrote this script as in conjuction with the larger process overhaul so that my
team had access to budgets whenever needed. 

Some data in the .xlsx file has been masked in order to stay compliant with client/agency NDA's
